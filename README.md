# leapdao-integ-tests

## 1. Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/leapdao/leapdao-integ-tests.git
cd leapdao-integ-tests
yarn
```

## 2. Build
The integration tests will be run against a version of the node and contracts software. In configs/build, you can specify what version you would like to use. It can be either a local folder or a remote github repository. Examples:
```
// To run against master
contracts_repo="https://github.com/leapdao/leap-contracts.git"
// To run against a specific branch 
contracts_repo=" --single-branch -b **branch_name** https://github.com/leapdao/leap-contracts.git"
// To run against a local folder
contracts_repo="/Users/you/code/leap-contracts"
```
When you are happy with your configuration, run:
```
yarn run build
```
This will generate a build folder in the project and fetch the repos and build them. Yarn logs of the build are available in build/logs.

## 3. Run tests
After you have built the projects, you can start the tests. Some parameters can be configured in configs/run. When you are happy with the congiguration, run:
```
yarn run test
```
This will:
1. launch a ganache network
2. deploy the contracts
3. start the configured number of nodes
4. perform setup tasks 
5. run all the tests in the tests directory 

The tests will write logs to a folder ./out/{current time}, where you can look for information about the test run (deployment log, ganache network log and a log for each of the nodes).
